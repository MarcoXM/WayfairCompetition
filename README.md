# Wayfair Competition

***Using Data to Bring Customers Home***

## Introdcuction

**Top candidates** will be invited to interview at Wayfair for opportunities within the Data Science team. There are open internships and full-time opportunities available!


## Detailed Description

### Project Overview
Wayfair is an e-commerce retailer that sells furniture and other home goods. While Wayfair mainly sells to individual consumers, it also has a large B2B (Business-to-Business) division that sells to business customers such as interior design firms, contractors, and hotels.

As a data-driven company, Wayfair ensures that our B2B customers receive best-in-class service by leveraging data science models to predict customer needs and purchasing patterns. Wayfairâ€™s marketing, sales, and operations teams utilize these models to guide business decisions.



## Project Description
The objective of this competition is to build two predictive models. Given a repository of customer information, sales call records, and purchase history, (data below) your task is to use machine learning methods to predict the following:

B2B customer conversion **(classification)**: Whether a B2B customer will purchase or not in the next 30 days

B2B customer expected revenue **(regression)**: How much a B2B customer will spend in the next 30 days

**So Generral speaking, this is a multitasks problem!!**


## Data and Dictionary

          i. convert_30 (boolean)
          ii. revenue_30 (numeric)

2. Holdout data (test data )

    * This data includes features but not outcome variables for a different set of customers. You will use these features to predict the missing outcome variables.

3. Dictionary to Define Variables
